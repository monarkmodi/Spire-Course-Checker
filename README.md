# Spire Course Checker
Checks periodically for any student's Spire shopping cart for open courses. I originally made this to help me get into a course that was full, so it needs to be generalized a bit more before it is ready for other people. It used to send me a text message when a course opened, but I removed this functionality since it was very specific to my needs.
